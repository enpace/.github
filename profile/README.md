## 🧭 What we do

### 🛠 IT Automation  
We help you operate your IT infrastructure and applications in a comprehensible, secure and documented way.  
Your CMDB (Configuration Management Database) becomes the foundation for deployment and operations.  
We automate across platforms — whether Windows, Linux or Kubernetes.

### 📈 Monitoring  
We support you in monitoring your IT systems, services and applications comprehensively.  
We are product-agnostic and bring years of experience across Windows, Linux, Kubernetes, Azure and more.

### 🧑‍💻 Open-Source Software  
At Enpace, we actively share tools that make IT automation and operations easier.
